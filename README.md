FrontEnd React App - Jonas Walden, Kory Newton, Gill Abada
This app uses React.js Redux and thunk to make Api calls to a mongoDb data base and retrieve information about pokemon.
This app has search functionality and the ability to compare pokemon cards to one another.
We have also implemented a login page and a sign up page using a secure token to access the pokemon API.
All the styles were done using styled components and hooks were used for the forms error handling was also implemented.
This app represents all and more of the tools we learned here at lambda school in the react portion of the course.
